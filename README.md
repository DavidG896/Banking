BANK

To use the XY Bank program, you begin by launching it and entering your password when prompted. If you do not have an account, you can create one by pressing "1" and setting a new password. Once the password is entered, the program will create your account with an initial balance of $500, and you can then use the new password to log in. After successfully logging in, you will be given the option to either calculate interest by typing "I" or check your balance by typing "B."

If you choose to calculate interest, the program will ask you to input the principal amount, the annual interest rate, and the time in years. It will then calculate the final balance using compound interest and display the result. If you decide to check your balance, the program will show your current balance and allow you to either withdraw or deposit money. For withdrawals, you need to specify the amount, and if your balance is sufficient, the program will deduct it. For deposits, you simply input the amount, and it will be added to your balance. The updated balance is saved and displayed after each transaction.

At any point when prompted, you can exit the program by typing "E." The program saves your password in a file named passwords.txt and your balance in balance.txt, so ensure these files are available and secure for the program to function correctly.
